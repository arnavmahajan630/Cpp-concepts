Inheritance is quite complex since we have many types of inheritances
*public
*private
*protected

=> for now ill focus only on public later Ill come back with books and refferences
for private and protected



A Derived class does not inherit the following stuff from base class:
Constructor
Destructor
overloaded assignment operator
friend functions

=> However the derived class equivalents can invoke base class versions

# !!! if we initialize a class Dervied D with param then it's not like the Base param will be called
while making of derived first the base no args is called then derived param is called
we need to explicitly call for this Base constructor with param in derived if we want it to be called
